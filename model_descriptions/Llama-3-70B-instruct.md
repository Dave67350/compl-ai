## model_description
<!--- Short description of the model -->
The Meta Llama 3 family of large language models (LLMs) is a collection of pretrained and instruction tuned generative text models in 8 and 70B sizes. The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized for dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks. Llama 3 70B is the largest and most capable model in the Llama 3 family.
